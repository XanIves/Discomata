# DnD-Avrae-GUI
Python GUI for sending text commands through a Discord bot.

# How To Run The Bot
To run this bot locally, you need to create a .env file that stores your discord bot token. This can be done with the following steps:

1. Open the /Code/ folder in your command line

2. run "pip -3.8 install -r requirements.txt"

3. Create a file called ".env" in the /Code/ folder. This can be done by renaming a textfile to .env. or by typing "touch .env" into your command line.

4. Open the .env file in notepad or another raw text editor, and type the following line, replacing "BotToken" with your Discord bot token:
    
    DISCORD_TOKEN=BotToken
   
5. Save the file and you should be good to go!

You can run this bot by running the command "python gui1.py" in Command Prompt or Terminal after navigating to the Code directory that gui1.py is stored in.
